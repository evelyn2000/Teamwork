== Welcome to Teamwork

Teamwork is an open-source task management system built using Ruby on Rails. It is suitable for small teams to keep constant tabs on projects, tasks and deadlines. Nothing complicated. Straight to the point.


== Getting Started

1. Download the whole application
2. Configure the 'config/googlecal.yml' to your google calendar account
3. Run it!

== Sharing is Caring

Would really appreciate anyone interested to fork this and add more useful features to it.
